        The websites you see on the internet have two sides. The first one is
        the one you see, and the other one works in the background to manage the
        data of the same. The former is called front-end development, and it
        consists of web design and its interface. The latter is called back-end
        development, and it deals with databases and server-side programming. To
        run a website optimally, you’ll need to invest in both of these
        sections. A website wouldn’t look great if it doesn’t have proper
        front-end development. Similarly, it wouldn’t be able to process its
        data if it lacks adequate back-end development. Both of these sectors
        are quite complex. Due to this reason, some experts specialize in one of
        these two branches of web development. However, some professionals are
        proficient in handling both of these sections of a website. They are
        called full-stack developers. Full-stack developers learn many
        programming languages and tools. These tools help developers in creating
        websites faster. One among them is the MEAN stack.

        Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages and tools a
        developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development
        of a website. MEAN stack, on the other hand, is a popular full-stack
        framework, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and NodeJS.
        Full-stack isn’t necessarily restricted to a particular set of
        languages, while frameworks like MEAN stack is. As a full-stack
        developer, you’ll have to learn multiple languages related to web
        development along with a few concepts of web design. Full-stack mainly
        refers to the developer, whereas MEAN stack is an acronym for a
        full-stack framework. Both of them are widely popular. And the demand
        for full stack developers is very high. However, there are a lot of
        areas where these two differ, apart from the ones we’ve discussed
        already.
