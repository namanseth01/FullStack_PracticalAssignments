              Betalabs.in CODE WANTS TO BE SIMPLE is an initiative to help the
              upcoming programmers with the code. Beta-Labs focuses on providing
              the most efficient code or snippets as the code wants to be simple.
              We will help programmers build up concepts in different programming
              languages that include C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
              JavaScript, PHP, Android, SQL and Algorithm.
