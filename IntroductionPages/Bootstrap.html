      JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting
      language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many
      non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
      Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript
      contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a
      core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and
      statements.
