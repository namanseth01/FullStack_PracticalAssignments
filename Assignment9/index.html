                  <h2>About Projects</h2>
                  <p>
                    A project is an activity to meet the creation of a unique product or service and thus activities that are undertaken to accomplish routine activities cannot be considered projects. For instance, if your project is less than three months old and has fewer than 20 people working on it, you may not be working in what is called a project according to the definition of the term. It has to be remembered that the term temporary does not apply to the result or service that is generated by the project.The project may be finite but not the result. For instance, a project to build a monument would be of fixed duration whereas the result that is the monument may be for an indefinite period in time. A project is an activity to create something unique. Of course, many of the office buildings that are built are similar in many respects but each individual facility is unique in its own way. Finally, a project must be progressively elaborated. This means that the project progresses in steps and continues by increments.
